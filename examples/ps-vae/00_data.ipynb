    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through how to download an example dataset, including some already trained models; the next notebook shows how to evaluate those models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, first make sure that you have properly installed the BehaveNet package and environment by following the instructions [here](https://behavenet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html). Specifically, (1) set up the Anaconda virtual environment; and (2) install the `BehaveNet` package. You do not need to set user paths at this time (this will be covered below).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the use of BehaveNet we will use an example dataset from the [International Brain Lab](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.17.909838v5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, a head-fixed mouse performed a visual decision-making task. Behavioral data was recorded using a single camera at 60 Hz frame rate. Grayscale video frames were downsampled to 192x192 pixels. We labeled the forepaw positions using [Deep Graph Pose](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/4379cf00e1a95a97a33dac10ce454ca4-Paper.pdf). Data consists of batches of 100 contiguous frames and their accompanying labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are stored on the IBL data repository; you will download this data after setting some user paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: make sure that you are running the `behavenet` ipython kernel - you should see the current ipython kernel name in the upper right hand corner of this notebook. If it is not `behavenet` (for example it might be `Python 3`) then change it using the dropdown menus above: `Kernel > Change kernel > behavenet`. If you do not see `behavenet` as an option see [here](https://behavenet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html#environment-setup).\n",

    "A note about the BehaveNet path structure: every dataset is uniquely identified by a lab id, experiment id, animal id, and session id. Paths to data and results contain directories for each of these id types. For example, a sample data path will look like `/home/user/data/lab_id/expt_id/animal_id/session_id/data.hdf5`.
