# BehaveNet

NOTE: The master branch contains the code version released with the neurips paper in November 2019; for more recent updates, see the develop branch.

BehaveNet is a probabilistic framework for the analysis of behavioral video and neural activity. 
This framework provides tools for compression, segmentation, generation, and decoding of behavioral 
videos. Please see the 
[paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9701-behavenet-nonlinear-embedding-and-bayesian-neural-decoding-of-behavioral-videos) 
for additional details about the algorithms, and see the
[BehaveNet documentation](https://behavenet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
for more information about how to install the software and begin fitting models to data. 

Additionally, we provide an example dataset and several jupyter notebooks that walk you through how 
to download the dataset, fit models, and analyze the results. The jupyter notebooks can be found 
[here](examples).
