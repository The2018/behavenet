# BehaveNet

NOTE: The master branch contains the code version released with the neurips paper in November 2019; for more recent updates, see the develop branch.

BehaveNet is a probabilistic framework for the analysis of behavioral video and neural activity. 
This framework provides tools for compression, segmentation, generation, and decoding of behavioral 
videos. Please see the 
[paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9701-behavenet-nonlinear-embedding-and-bayesian-neural-decoding-of-behavioral-videos) 
for additional details about the algorithms, and see the
[BehaveNet documentation](https://behavenet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
for more information about how to install the software and begin fitting models to data.
